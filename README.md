## Projects
- [Post Service](https://github.com/proxylunae/post-service) - This project is a post service using js, html, csss and react. This application fetches posts from json placeholder api using axios library. The application implements authorization simulation, the ability to view individual posts, the ability to customize the sorting of posts, search for posts by matches. Also, the application implements dynamic pagination and the choice of the limit of posts on the page.
- [To-Do List](https://github.com/proxylunae/todoList) - A simple to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using local storage to persist data. The app also allows users to export and import their to-dos as a .txt file.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. Feel free to contact me to discuss potential opportunities or just to chat about technology.
